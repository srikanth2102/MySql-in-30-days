### *DAY 8-14*
* We will write queries using the employees database.
* Previously we only worked with databases with a single table. Now we will work with multiple tables.
* The database that will be used from day 8-14 is taken from [here](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db).
* Follow the instructions in that github repository to install the database in your localhost.
* If you have any problems installing the database there are many youtube videos available on how to install it. Refer and do it.

### *OVERVIEW OF EMPLOYEES DATABASE*
* This database is widely used to practice SQL queries.
* This database has six tables employees, dept_manager, department, dept_emp, salaries, titles.
